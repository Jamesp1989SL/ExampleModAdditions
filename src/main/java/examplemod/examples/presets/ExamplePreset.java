         *
         * width / height
         *   - Size of the structure.
         *
         * tileIDs + tiles
         *   - "tileIDs" is a list of tile types used in this preset.
         *   - "tiles" is the full grid.
         *   - Each number in "tiles" refers to an entry from tileIDs.
         *
         * objectIDs + objects
         *   - Same idea as tiles, but for objects
         *   - "objectIDs" is the palette.
         *   - "objects" is the full grid.
         *
         * rotations
         *   - Rotation for each placed object (same length/order as the objects grid).
         *   - Most objects use rotation 0/1/2/3 for directions.
         *
         * ...Clear flags...
         *   - These tell the game whether it should clear decorations/walls/etc when stamping the preset.
         *
         * The string is huge because it contains *every tile* in the 11x11 grid.
         * 11 x 11 = 121 entries, which matches the long arrays you see.
